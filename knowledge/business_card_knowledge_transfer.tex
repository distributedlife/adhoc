\section*{knowledge transfer - business cards}
\begin{enumerate}
\item get a stack of old business cards
\item host a session with the team to determine areas of the product
\item write each area on a business card
\item put all the business cards in a box
\item give the box to a new hire
\item the new hire has 2-3 weeks to use each card
\item the new hire can take any card from the box and ask anyone in the team about the area
\item if that person doesn't know then they have to come with the new hire to find someone that does
\end{enumerate}
