\section*{performance - risk - identify}
\begin{itemize}
\item valuable (economic) system output - especially for outliers
\item tight (realistic) time oriented requirements
\item data volumes high (number of objects - not just total, but distribution across customer / products - maybe outliers matter)
\item transaction volumes high
\item data sizes large (the width of the object)
\end{itemize}

If we have two or more than we have a risk.
