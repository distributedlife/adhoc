In order to "benefit"

As a "persona"

I want "solution"
\subsection*{notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item it puts the benefit yielded by the story first

In order to "relative term" "benefit"

We will "verb" "solution"
\subsection*{notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item forces the author to provide a relative term to the benefit rather than just a benefit. e.g. increase click-through rates
\item forces the solution to start with a verb e.g. allow multi-day parking in one call
\item can use the "verb solution" as what to write on the card "allow multi-day parking in one call"
\end{enumerate}
