\section*{stories - what are they?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item a promise to hold a conversation
\item the recorded details are never enough
\item a delta to the system
\item a place to document decisions
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item do we call victory when the feature (the solution) is implemented or when the benefit is delivered?
\item can we ever document everything that can exist around the story?
\item we have conversations because we know not everything is documented
\end{enumerate}
