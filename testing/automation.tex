\section*{testing - automation - spectrum - 1}
All testing sits upon a spectrum between manual and automatic. There is value all along the spectrum.

The manual test is exploratory. What is covered changes with each execution and changes during execution as the tester responds to and learns from the behaviour of the system.

The semi-automatic test is each little piece of code that helps you undertake a test, but doesn't do the test for you. A script that prepares an input file from a spreadsheet, a button you can press to lodge an order that would otherwise take 20 minutes across several systems.

The automatic test includes all the unit tests out there. These run frequently, often without direct user input (i.e. as part of a continuous integration server).
