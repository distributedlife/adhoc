\begin{enumerate}
\item Write on a white board the following sequence: 2,4,6,8
\item Tell the group that they can suggest any number, you will say if it is in the sequence or not. Write each number they say at the end of the sequence, if it is in the sequence.
\item Write numbers that are not in the sequence elsewhere.
\item When the group thinks they have enough information then they should yell out the sequence

\section*{testing - confirming questions - 2}
\subsection*{notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The actual sequence is that each number must be greater than the prior number.
\item Many groups will continue the sequence 10,12, etc
\item If they answer anything other than the correct sequence; talk to the group about the types of questions they asked. Numbers like 10, 12, 14, etc just confirm what the group already knows. Numbers like -50, 5, 12.5 and 1 billion all challenge what is currently known.
\end{itemize}
